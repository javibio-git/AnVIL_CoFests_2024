CollaborationFests!, also known as CoFests! (and sometimes as “hackathons”), are collaborative work events where we expand and improve the AnVIL community and the AnVIL ecosystem. Sometimes these gatherings are focused on AnVIL, and sometimes they are part of larger communities. Modified from https://galaxyproject.org/events/cofests What’s in a name: CollaborationFests! and Hackathons We collaborate. AnVIL collaborative events are emphatically called CollaborationFests! rather than Hackathons. Putting Collaboration in the name emphasizes what the events are about for us, and Fest communicates that they are fun events (which they are). “Hackathon” implies an emphasis on code. CoFests! are about contributing and learning how to contribute to all aspects of AnVIL, including training material, community infrastructure, documentation, unit tests, bug reports, and yes, even code. First and foremost AnVIL CoFests! are about growing the community of future contributors. Idea inspiration from [GCC2024][GCC2018] Reporting inspiration from [BioC2018][BioC2020][BioC2023] AnVIL Collection Please check out our full collection of AnVIL and related resources: https://hutchdatascience.org/AnVIL_Collection/ "],["organizer-guide.html", "Organizer Guide CoFests! Goals Logistics Final Product / Report Out Example Schedule for a Track", " Organizer Guide The inaugural AnVIL Community Conference (ACC) 2024 will take place on November 12-13, 2024 in Cold Spring Harbor, NY, immediately before the sixth meeting on Biological Data Science. Overall, ACC is a key event for professionals in the genomics community interested in biomedical and genomic cloud computing and features keynotes, town halls, CoFests! and other such component events. CoFests! provide attendees the opportunity to get some hands-on experience with AnVIL and foster connections within the AnVIL community. CoFests! Goals Build an inclusive community that is supportive of newcomers Collaborate and contribute to open science Produce a final product that accomplishes one of the following for a topic Makes useful forward progress Identifies opportunities and boundaries or limitations Logistics 3 Parallel tracks, 5+ hours across Nov 12/13 Scalable Machine Learning and Data Science Polygenic Risk Score Analysis Wrap a Tool (+ Intro AnVIL/WDL) Scientific Lead and AnVIL Outreach co-Lead for support We expect 4-10 participants per track Prior to the CoFests, the scientific and AnVIL Outreach co-Leads will work together to enumerate some ideas for final products and post them publicly in this book. The AnVIL Outreach co-Lead will help add content to this guide, onboard newer AnVIL users to the platform, and provide guidance on the final product / report out. Final Product / Report Out The final product of CoFests doesn’t need to be code! These Collaboration Fests can support story-boarding future work or development of documentation or training materials. If it’s something that will help the community and make progress on an AnVIL associated topic and there’s sufficient interest, the idea is game! As Galaxy phrased it for their CoFests: [The goal of collaboration fests is to expand the ecosystem] Not just the code, but the whole ecosystem. That includes training, tools, best practice workflows, documentation, test cases, translations, infrastructure, and yes, even code. It helps us a lot if you can fill out some basic Report Out details. At the end of Day 2, your track will share a final report during the CoFest Recap Session! Example Schedule for a Track Day 1 (2.5 hours) Task Time &amp; Lead Problem statement. Provide background info on the track’s overall topic and may include a brief summary of the pre-worked collaboration ideas. 20-30 minutes (Scientific Lead) Brainstorming. What project will the track tackle? Focus on understanding the participant backgrounds and skills and matching those with track ideas and actionable tasks to accomplish the goal. 15-30 minutes (Both) Onboarding. Handle billing accounts and other logistics necessary to accomplish the work. 30-60 minutes (AnVIL Outreach co-Lead) Work-regroup, work-regroup. Formal collaboration work time left before dinner. (Groups may choose to work together informally after dinner too) 30-60 minutes (N/A) Day 2 (3 hours) Task Time &amp; Lead Work-regroup, work-regroup. Formal collaboration work time (with a coffee break). 2-2.5 hours (N/A) Construct a “report out”. The report out may be a Google doc, Google slides, a GitHub repository, a website, an OTTR book, etc. 30-60 minutes (AnVIL Outreach co-Lead) "],["scalable-ml-and-data-science.html", "Chapter 1 Scalable ML and Data Science", " Chapter 1 Scalable ML and Data Science "],["polygenic-risk-score-analysis.html", "Chapter 2 Polygenic Risk Score Analysis", " Chapter 2 Polygenic Risk Score Analysis "],["how-to-run-your-tool-in-anvil-with-wdl.html", "Chapter 3 How to Run Your Tool in AnVIL with WDL", " Chapter 3 How to Run Your Tool in AnVIL with WDL "],["about-the-authors.html", "About the Authors", " About the Authors These credits are based on our course contributors table guidelines.     Credits Names Pedagogy Lead Content Instructor(s) FirstName LastName Lecturer(s) (include chapter name/link in parentheses if only for specific chapters) -
