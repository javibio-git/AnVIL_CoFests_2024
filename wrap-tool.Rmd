# How to Run Your Tool in AnVIL with WDL

Led by: Allie Cliffe, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard

AnVIL Outreach coordinator: Javier Carpinteyro-Ponce


Workflow Description Language (WDL) not in your programming skillset? No problem! Learn to wrap your pipelining tool in WDL and run it in an AnVIL workspace in this CoFest session. We’ll go over WDL basics and how to run pipelines in AnVIL, then walk through how to run your own Unix/Python/R script. Along the way, you’ll write a WDL and build a custom Docker to run it with. Come and wrap a tool of interest! All experience levels are welcome. If time allows, we’ll emerge with some resources for others to run their non-WDL tool in AnVIL.
