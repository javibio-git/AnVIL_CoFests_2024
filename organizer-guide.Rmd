## CoFests! Goals {- .unlisted}

- Build an inclusive community that is supportive of newcomers
- Contribute to [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)
- Produce a final product that accomplishes one of the following for a topic
  - Makes useful forward progress
  - Identifies opportunities and boundaries or limitations

The final product of CoFests doesn't need to be code! These Collaboration Fests can support story-boarding future work or development of documentation or training materials. If it's something that will help the community and make progress on an AnVIL associated topic and there's sufficient interest, the idea is game! [As Galaxy phrased it for their CoFests:](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2023/cofest/#goals)

> [The goal of collaboration fests is to expand the ecosystem] Not just the code, but the whole ecosystem. That includes training, tools, best practice workflows, documentation, test cases, translations, infrastructure, and yes, even code.  

Prior to the CoFests, the scientific and AnVIL co-leads will work together to enumerate some ideas for final products and post them publicly in this book.

## Logistics {- .unlisted}

- 3 Parallel tracks, 5+ hours across Nov 12/13
  - Scalable Machine Learning and Data Science
  - Polygenic Risk Score Analysis
  - Wrap a Tool (+ Intro AnVIL/WDL)
- Scientific Lead and AnVIL Outreach Co-Lead for support
- We expect 4-10 participants per track

## Example Schedule for a Track {- .unlisted}

- First Day (2.5 hrs scheduled):
  - Problem statement by scientific lead

    This part of the session will provide background info on the track's overall topic and may include a brief summary of the pre-worked ideas. [Suggested time: 20-30 minutes]

  - Brainstorming

    What project will the track tackle? This should be quicker then the problem statement, focusing on understanding the participant backgrounds and skills and matching those with track ideas and actionable tasks to accomplish the goal.

  - Onboarding by AnVIL co-lead

    Handle billing accounts and other logistics necessary to accomplish the work.

  - Work-regroup, work-regroup

    Probably half an hour to an hour of formal work time left on this first day before dinner. Groups may choose to work together, informally after dinner.

- Second Day (3 hrs scheduled):
  - Work-regroup, work-regroup
  - Construct a "report out"

    The report out may be a Google doc, Google slides, a GitHub repo, [a website](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template_Website), an [OTTR book](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template), etc.

- Share final report during the CoFest Recap Session!
